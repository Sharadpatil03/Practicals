Mean Squared Error is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models. It measures the average squared difference 
between the actual values (the ground truth or target values) and the predicted values produced by a model.
 
confustion matrix: 
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the results of a classification problem by showing the counts of actual versus predicted classifications, broken down into categories of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The matrix helps in visualizing the accuracy of the model and provides a deeper understanding of where it is making errors
accuracy =tp+tn /total
error rate = 1-accuracy
precision =tp / predited yes
recall =tn /actual yes
